##General

Our software project titled "NSA 4 Dummies" is a small, lightweight application to show unencrpyted traffic and IP-Routing in your own home network. There's no need for further knowledge regarding network security, so this tool is for everyone who want's to get a fast and general overview of their data traffic.  
"NSA 4 Dummies" was developed by a team of students from the "Technische Universität Ilmenau" during their mandatory 4th semester course called "Softwareprojekt".

Using the software does not violate §202a, §202b, §202c StGB.
